# Lab02-STARTER
Students should use their files from their solution to Lab01: demogData.cpp, demogData.h, main.cpp, parse.cpp, parse.h, tddFuncs.cpp, tddFuncs.h

Note that the following files are empty and need to be completed per the lab assignment: dataAQ.h, dataAQ.cpp, stateDemog.cpp, stateDemog.h, and parse.cpp.  Besure that the order of variables in the constructor of demogData matches your revised class (you do need to add total county population to demogData).
